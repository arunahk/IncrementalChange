# Incremental Change

## Mobile App Information

[Mobile App Prototype](https://share.proto.io/R8FPU2/)

Our problem focused on customer interaction with charities.

> Traditionally, charities have relied on running annual appeals in order to increase donations and publicise their causes. However, the medium of spending money is changing. Cash usage in New Zealand is declining year on year, and it is not so common to have change rattling round in your pocket waiting to be spent. 

> This has seen donation values fall.

> In data supplied by the Inland Revenue in 2015,  it shows the number of people filing a tax return to claim a tax rebate on donations has fallen year-on-year over the past three tax years, from 383,144 in the year to March 2013 to 359,541 in the 2015 year. Individual taxpayers can claim back 33 per cent of donations over . It is estimated that fewer than 60 per cent of donations are claimed.

> Our challenge to you is we want to see you hack your way to a proposition that will increase the publicâ€™s contribution to charities once more!

We aimed to provide a solution that would...
* Provide a way to select the best charity for the customer.
* Set up your "Inceremental Change" (A type of donation that would round up each of your eftpos transactions to the nearest dollar and donate the difference to your charity)
* Keep track of how much you have donated, where your money is going and reward you based on your donations.
* Help streamline the process for tax rebates.

Our app allows you to set up a profile that tracks your total donations, shows you your next milestone to reach and shows information about your current charity. When setting up your account you can search for your favourite charity, or search for charities by different filters. It then allows you to set up an "Incremental Change" way of donation or a lump-sum payment, you can select to give your money to certain projects that each charity is running and split your donations across the board. After you have selected your charity you start donating each time you make a transaction. You can log in to your account and see your tally to see where you're at.
